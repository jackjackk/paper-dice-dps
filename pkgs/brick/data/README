forcing_rcp26.csv   Radiative forcing file for projections, using RCP 2.6
forcing_rcp45.csv   Radiative forcing file for projections, using RCP 4.5
forcing_rcp6.csv    Radiative forcing file for projections, using RCP 6
forcing_rcp85.csv   Radiative forcing file for projections, using RCP 8.5
                    These files are used to force DOECLIM.
                    They come from the data available at

HadCRUT.4.4.0.0.annual_ns_avg_realisations (directory)
    Contains the individual ensemble members, along with the uncertainty
    estimates, which are important for calibration of DOECLIM.
