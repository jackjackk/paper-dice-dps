This directory is reserved for the R interfaces between the R driver code and
the physical models coded in Fortran.

The doeclimF.R model is the supported version of Fortran DOECLIM called from R.
It has had the "total_forcing" function, which applies the "alpha.doeclim"
aerosol scaling parameter (essentially uncertainty in the forcing data) to the
radiative forcing, and adds it all up. This function is now "forcing_total.R" in
the /robustslr/R directory with the rest of the R models.

The doeclim_classic.R model is the older version, with the "forcing_total"
function still intact as part of the doeclim model.
