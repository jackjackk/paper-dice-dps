To obtain calibrated (MCMC) model parameters for the coupled BRICK model (except
for DAIS), the following routines are required:

in /calibration/
  BRICK_calib_driver.R        Driver script for the MCMC calibration. This file
                              includes definition of which sub-models to include.
  BRICK_parameterSetup.R      Script to set up the parameter names, default values,
                              and upper/lower prior bounds. Also sets up the
                              indices for model/statistical parameters.
  BRICK_DEoptim.R             Script defining a residual-minimizing metric for
                              using the differential evolution optimization
                              algorithm to obtain a better initial parameter
                              choice, which will speed up the MCMC convergence.

  forcing_total.R             fucntion to add up the total radiative forcing
                              (This was formerly part of DOECLIM but has been
                              separated for transparency and to make the DOECLIM
                              version in BRICK coded analogously to the other
                              physical models.)

                              model output and observational data vectors

in /data/
  forcing_hindcast.csv


See the README file in the /data/ directory for an overview of the various
sources of calibration and forcing data.

Following the commands in BRICK_calib_driver.R will result in calibrated model
parameters, written by default into a file

  ../output_calibration/BRICK_calibratedParameters_[date-stamp].nc

Each row is a different concomitant parameter set for the sub-models. Each
column is a different model parameter, with the first row giving the parameter
names.

See README_calibration_DAIS for a description of how the DAIS model is
calibrated (using the same RAM-MCMC approach as here), leading up to creation
of the DAIS calibrated parameters file

  ../output_calibration/DAIS_calibratedParameters_[date-stamp].nc

================================================================================
A couple notes about the calibration:
  * The calibration method is a robust adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo
    algorithm (RAM-MCMC), and is described well in Vihola (2012),
    doi:10.1007/s11222-011-9269-5.
  * Getting about 500,000 iterations is typically enough. This requires ~20 minutes
    on a typical modern multi-core laptop computer, and can be run in parallel
    with minimum overhead cost for parallelization onto multiple physical cores,
    and slightly more overhead cost for parallelization onto multiple threads
    within a core.
  * To check how many physical cores your machine has, run in R:
      detectCores(logical=FALSE)
  * To check how many logical cores (accounts for multi-threading), run:
      detectCores(logical=TRUE)
  * It is safe to assume that for ~100,000 or more (reasonable MCMC lengths)
    iterations, it is worth it to run parallel chains. This provides:
      (1) additional posterior samples at little additional computational cost
      (2) more robust Gelman and Rubin convergence statistics (for when
          inter-chain variability ~ intra-chain variability)
    but unfortunately you do not get a progress bar, and adding samples to a
    parallel MCMC object cannot be done in parallel. So estimate how many samples
    you will need and how long it will take ahead of time.
  * The post-calibrated parameter files and physical/Van Dantzig model output
    are in netCDF form with n.ensemble (or something similarly suggestive to
    that) as the unlimited dimension. This is so multiple post-calibrated files
    may be combined using the ‘ncrcat’ function. If you need to obtain netCDF,
    go here to obtain the pre-built executables for your system:
    http://nco.sourceforge.net/#RTFM

    If you have two calibrated parameters files you would like to combine, and
    they are called

    BRICK_a.nc and BRICK_b.nc

    you can do

    ncrcat BRICK_a.nc BRICK_b.nc BRICK_ab.nc

    to create the file BRICK_ab.nc. The 'ncrcat' command automatically
    concatenates based on the 'unlimited' dimension. The post-calibrated BRICK
    parameter files have the number of ensemble members conveniently as the
    unlimited dimension.

================================================================================
Additional observational datasets for calibration may be introduced by making
the following modifications. 

In the calibration directory:
1. [submodel]_readData.R – read the dataset, match the model and observational
                           data indices (using “compute_indices” function)
2. BRICK_calib_driver.R  – add to the obs.all, obs.err.all, midx.all, oidx.all,
                           ind.norm.data lists (these tell the 
                           BRICK_assimLikelihood.R routines how to compare the
                           model and data)
3. BRICK_assimLikelihood.R – calculate a likelihood function value for these 
                             data and add to “log.lik” routine. Note that simply
                             adding the log-likelihood from the new dataset 
                             assumes independence between residuals from one 
                             dataset to the next.
In the data directory:
1. Add the dataset, and make sure to point to this in [submodel]_readData.R.
