For the impatient:


Make projections by running from the terminal (not in R) command line:

  Rscript run_BRICK.R <file.settings> <file.parameters> <file.inputdata> <file.output>

where
  file.settings       column 1 is the setting name, column 2 is setting value,
                      column 3 is for comments, beneficial to user, but not used here
                      Good practice: keep settings file in the run-time directory.
                      (i.e., wherever this driver script is)
                      Default provided: /calibration/BRICK_settings.csv
  file.parameters     file with each row a different set of model parameters at
                      which to run the model, and each column a different model
                      parameter
                      Good practice: Keep the parameters files in the
                      /output_calibration/ directory, and refer specifically to
                      the one you want in the execute command.
                      Default provided: /output_calibration/BRICK_postcalibratedParameters_21Jul2016.csv
  file.inputdata      radiative forcing to use
                      Good practice: Keep the forcing files in the /data/
                      directory.
                      Provided: /data/forcing_rcp{26,45,6,85}.csv
  file.output         file to write the sea-level rise output to
                      Good practice: keep this in the /output/ directory.
                      Default provided: none (user-defined)

and the run-time directory is wherever the script run_BRICK.R is located (by
default, in the /calibration/ directory).

                              separated for transparency and to make the DOECLIM
                              version in BRICK coded analogously to the other
                              physical models.)

                              Antarctic ocean temperature from global temperature

  doeclim.so                  dynamic library required to run the Fortran version
                              of the DOECLIM physical model

See below for first, combining the results of the DAIS pre-calibration MCMC and the
rest-of-model BRICK MCMC calibration, and second, making projections interactively.


Requires:

in /calibration/
  BRICK_combinePostcalibration.R      driver script for the post-calibration
  BRICK_postcalibratedProjections.R   driver script to use the post-calibrated
                              parameters from BRICK_combinePostcalibration.R (or
                              a pre-existing parameter set such as those provided)
                              and make projections of sea-level rise

in /data/
  forcing_hindcast.csv        use the hindcast forcing to post-calibrate/assimilate
                              all model parameters

in /R/ and /fortran/, need all of the same model files as above

In BRICK_combinePostcalibration.R:

Input:
  Output calibrated parameters from DAIS and the rest-of-model:
    ../output_calibration/BRICK_calibratedParameters_[date-stamp].csv
    ../output_calibration/DAIS_precalibrationMCMC_parameters_[date-stamp].csv

Output:
  Post-calibrated parameters:
    ../output_calibration/BRICK_postcalibratedParameters_[date-stamp].csv

Before projections are made, the separately-calibrated DAIS model posterior
parameters must be assimilated with the rest-of-model posterior parameters. This
is done in a "post-calibration" step, by only choosing parameters which yield
hindcast simulations of global mean sea-level rise which pass through a tunnel
around the Church and White (2011) sea level data.
